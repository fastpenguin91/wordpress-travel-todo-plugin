This is a WordPress Plugin. It's a TODO list for travelers. I guess you could use it for anything,

but the idea is to create multiple lists, and when you add a TODO you can select which list it belongs on.

So I would create  list called "California" for all the things I need to do in California.

Not done yet, but you can clone the repo and upload it as a plugin to see what the plugin does so far.
